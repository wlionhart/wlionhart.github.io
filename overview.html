      <h3><em>What I will be creating:</em></h3>
      <p>As a personal project, I would like to develop a professional online portfolio. In the digital era, it still bewilders me that the main mode of prospecting for jobs relies on the archaic method of drafting a résumé and cover letter. And, it is very cut-and-dry.  I think there are more powerful ways an individual can demonstrate their talents and experiences. Websites like LinkedIn do a wonderful job at taking a mundane exercise and enabling its users to intuitively display their works with an easy to handle UI.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3><em>What it involves:</em></h3>
      <p>In its inception, I would like to have my web portfolio contain several sections:</p>
      <div id="pg2ul">
      <ul>
        <li>'About Me' section</li>
        <li>Personal portfolio</li>
        <li>Blog</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p>That's all for now!</p>
      <br>
      <h3><em>Why I want to do it:</em></h3>
      <p>Coding is magical. There is something about the process that keeps me engrossed and engaged. It is tough work that is teeming with error and frustation. I find designing a program or creating a website has analogs to writing. In my field of study I've spent countless hours reading and drafting. It is always the case that something needs to be  expressed with balance and precision with just the right amount of words and, with just the right words. For me, this is what I consider "right stuff" or "the magic." However, what one writes is not always the same as what one reads. As such, what one may think has been perfectly written is not one that has been perfectly translated or interpreted. This is the ambiguity of language. Thus, there are times when the satisfaction of the magic is elusive.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With coding I feel the attainment of the "the magic" is something different. Yes, one can get mired in the laborious nature of grunt work. Yes, it is usually an undertaking that is error prone and extremely frustrating. But, there is a moment. A moment of suspense. It is the moment of arrival: where you know you are close, yet also knowing the possibility you may be further than expected. You have toiled; and,you are weary. Yet, one more step may be the last before viewing the entirety of your creation.</p>

      <p id="ender">And, with that, there is magic.</p>
